# AIOPS-LLM-DOCKER-GEN

🐳 Dockerfile Generator
A GenAI powered tool that generates optimized Dockerfiles based on programming language input. This project uses Ollama with the Llama3 model to create Dockerfiles following best practices.


💡 How It Works
The script takes a programming language as input (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java)
Connects to the Ollama API running locally
Generates an optimized Dockerfile with best practices for the specified language
Returns the Dockerfile content with explanatory comments.
